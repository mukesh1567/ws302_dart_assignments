/*
13) In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the
player has to guess, letter by letter. The player guesses one letter at a
time until the entire word has been guessed. (In the actual game, the
player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).
 Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many
guesses they have left.
 Keep track of the letters user guessed. If the user guesses a
letter they had already guessed, don’t penalise them - let
them guess again.*/
